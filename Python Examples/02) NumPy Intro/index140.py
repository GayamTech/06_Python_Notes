# Can We Reshape Into any Shape?
# Yes, as long as the elements required for reshaping are equal in both shapes.

# We can reshape an 8 elements 1D array into 4 elements in 2 rows 2D array but we cannot reshape it into a 3 elements 3 rows 2D array as that would require 3x3 = 9 elements.

# Example
# Try converting 1D array with 8 elements to a 2D array with 3 elements in each dimension (will raise an error):
