# NumPy Creating Arrays

# NumPy is used to work with arrays. The array object in NumPy is called ndarray.

# We can create a NumPy ndarray object by using the array() function.

# type(): This built-in Python function tells us the type of the object passed to it. Like in above code it shows that arr is numpy.ndarray type.
