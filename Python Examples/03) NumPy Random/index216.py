# Rayleigh Distribution
# Rayleigh distribution is used in signal processing.

# It has two parameters:

# scale - (standard deviation) decides how flat the distribution will be default 1.0).

# size - The shape of the returned array.



# Example
# Draw out a sample for rayleigh distribution with scale of 2 with size 2x3:
