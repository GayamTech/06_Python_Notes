# Random Permutations
# Random Permutations of Elements

# A permutation refers to an arrangement of elements. e.g. [3, 2, 1] is a permutation of [1, 2, 3] and vice-versa.

# The NumPy Random module provides two methods for this: shuffle() and permutation().

# Shuffling Arrays
# Shuffle means changing arrangement of elements in-place. i.e. in the array itself.



# Example
# Randomly shuffle elements of following array:




# The shuffle() method makes changes to the original array.
