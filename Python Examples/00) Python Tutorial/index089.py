# Raise an exception
# As a Python developer you can choose to throw an exception if a condition occurs.

# To throw (or raise) an exception, use the raise keyword.

# Example
# Raise an error and stop the program if x is lower than 0:



x = -1

print(" ")

if x < 0:
  raise Exception("Sorry, no numbers below zero")


print(" ")
