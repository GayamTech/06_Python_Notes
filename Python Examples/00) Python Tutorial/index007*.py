# Remember that variable names are case-sensitive


# A variable can have a short name (like x and y) or a more descriptive name (age, carname, total_volume). Rules for Python variables:
# A variable name must start with a letter or the underscore character
# A variable name cannot start with a number
# A variable name can only contain alpha-numeric characters and underscores (A-z, 0-9, and _ )

# no hyphens - !

# Variable names are case-sensitive (age, Age and AGE are three different variables)


# Camel Case
# Each word, except the first, starts with a capital letter:


myVariableName = "John7"
print(myVariableName)



# Pascal Case
# Each word starts with a capital letter:

MyVariableName = "John8"
print(MyVariableName)


# Snake Case
# Each word is separated by an underscore character:

my_variable_name = "John9"
print(my_variable_name)
