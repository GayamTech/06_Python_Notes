# Default X-Points
# If we do not specify the points in the x-axis, they will get the default values 0, 1, 2, 3, (etc. depending on the length of the y-points.

# So, if we take the same example as above, and leave out the x-points, the diagram will look like this:




# Example
# Plotting without x-points:


# The x-points in the example above is [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5].
