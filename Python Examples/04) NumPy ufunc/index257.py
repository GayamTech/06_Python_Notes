# NumPy LCM Lowest Common Multiple
# Finding LCM (Lowest Common Multiple)
# The Lowest Common Multiple is the least number that is common multiple of both of the numbers.



# Example
# Find the LCM of the following two numbers:


# Returns: 12 because that is the lowest common multiple of both numbers (4*3=12 and 6*2=12).
