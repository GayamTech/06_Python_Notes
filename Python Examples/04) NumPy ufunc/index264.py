# Convert Degrees Into Radians

# By default all of the trigonometric functions take radians as parameters but we can convert radians to degrees and vice versa as well in NumPy.

# Note: radians values are pi/180 * degree_values.




# Example
# Convert all of the values in following array arr to radians:
