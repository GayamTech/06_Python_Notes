# In Python, variables are created when you assign a value to it



# Python has no command for declaring a variable.




x = 5
y = "Hello, World!"

print(x)   #This is a comment

# Comments can be placed at the end of a line, and Python will ignore the rest of the line

print(y)


# Or, not quite as intended, you can use a multiline string.

#This is a comment
#written in
#more than just one line


# As long as the string is not assigned to a variable, Python will read the code, but then ignore it, and you have made a multiline comment.

# Since Python will ignore string literals that are not assigned to a variable, you can add a multiline string (triple quotes) in your code, and place your comment inside it



# Python has commenting capability for the purpose of in-code documentation.

# Comments start with a #, and Python will render the rest of the line as a comment:

#This is a comment.
