# Python Math
# Python has a set of built-in math functions, including an extensive math module, that allows you to perform mathematical tasks on numbers.



# Built-in Math Functions
# The min() and max() functions can be used to find the lowest or highest value in an iterable:



x = min(5, 10, 25)
y = max(5, 10, 25)


print(" ")


print(x)
print(y)






# The abs() function returns the absolute (positive) value of the specified number:


print(" ")


z = abs(-7.25)

print(z)













# The pow(x, y) function returns the value of x to the power of y (xy).

# Example
# Return the value of 4 to the power of 3 (same as 4 * 4 * 4):

print(" ")


a = pow(4, 3)

print(a)


print(" ")
