# Variables in Module

# The module can contain functions, as already described, but also variables of all types (arrays, dictionaries, objects etc):


# Import the module named mymodule, and access the person1 dictionary:


import mymodule1


print(" ")

a = mymodule1.person1["age"]

print(a)


print(" ")
