# The Math Module
# Python has also a built-in module called math, which extends the list of mathematical functions.

# To use it, you must import the math module:

# import math



# When you have imported the math module, you can start using methods and constants of the module.


#The math.sqrt() method for example, returns the square root of a number:


import math

b = math.sqrt(64)

print(b)
