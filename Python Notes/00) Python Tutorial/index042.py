# Python - Access Set Items



# Access Items
# You cannot access items in a set by referring to an index or a key.

# But you can loop through the set items using a for loop, or ask if a specified value is present in a set, by using the in keyword.

# Example
# Loop through the set, and print the values:




thisset = {"apple", "banana", "cherry"}

for x in thisset:
  print(x)











# Example
# Check if "banana" is present in the set:


thisset1 = {"apple", "banana", "cherry"}

print("banana" in thisset1)











# Change Items


# Once a set is created, you cannot change its items, but you can add new items.
