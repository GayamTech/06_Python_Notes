# Output Variables
# The Python print statement is often used to output variables.





# To combine both text and a variable, Python uses the + character


a = "Python is "
b = "awesome"
c =  a + b
print(c)






# For numbers, the + character works as a mathematical operator

x = 5
y = 10
print(x + y)
