# NumPy GCD Greatest Common Denominator
# Finding GCD (Greatest Common Denominator)
# The GCD (Greatest Common Denominator), also known as HCF (Highest Common Factor) is the biggest number that is a common factor of both of the numbers.







# Example
# Find the HCF of the following two numbers:




# Returns: 3 because that is the highest number both numbers can be divided by (6/3=2 and 9/3=3).
