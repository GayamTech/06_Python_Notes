# NumPy Logs

# Logs
# NumPy provides functions to perform log at the base 2, e and 10.

# We will also explore how we can take log for any base by creating a custom ufunc.

# All of the log functions will place -inf or inf in the elements if the log can not be computed.

# Log at Base 2
# Use the log2() function to perform log at the base 2.




# Example
# Find log at base 2 of all elements of following array:



# Note: The arange(1, 10) function returns an array with integers starting from 1 (included) to 10 (not included).
