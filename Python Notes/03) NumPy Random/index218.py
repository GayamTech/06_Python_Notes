# Pareto Distribution
# A distribution following Pareto's law i.e. 80-20 distribution (20% factors cause 80% outcome).

# It has two parameter:

# a - shape parameter.

# # size - The shape of the returned array.





# Example
# Draw out a sample for pareto distribution with shape of 2 with size 2x3:
