from scipy import constants

print(constants.liter)










# Now we have imported the constants module from SciPy, and the application is ready to use it:

# Example
# How many cubic meters are in one liter:


# constants: SciPy offers a set of mathematical constants, one of them is liter which returns 1 liter as cubic meters.

# You will learn more about constants in the next chapter.

# SciPy stands for Scientific Python.




# SciPy Introduction

# SciPy is a scientific computation library that uses NumPy underneath.

# SciPy stands for Scientific Python.

# It provides more utility functions for optimization, stats and signal processing.

# Like NumPy, SciPy is open source so we can use it freely.

# Why Use SciPy?
# If SciPy uses NumPy underneath, why can we not just use NumPy?

# SciPy has optimized and added functions that are frequently used in NumPy and Data Science.



# github: enables many people to work on the same codebase.
